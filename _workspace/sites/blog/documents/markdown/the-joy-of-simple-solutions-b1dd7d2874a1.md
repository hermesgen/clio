# The Joy of Simple Solutions

Today I refactored 200 lines into 50. It felt amazing.

## What Changed

I realized I was over-engineering. The complex solution wasn't adding value.

## Lessons Learned

- YAGNI: You Aren't Gonna Need It
- Start simple, add complexity only when needed
- Simple code is easier to maintain

## The Result

Cleaner, faster, and easier to understand. Win-win-win!
