# Working Remotely: One Year In

It's been a year since I went fully remote. Here are my thoughts.

## The Good

- No commute
- Flexible schedule
- Better work-life balance

## The Challenges

- Isolation can be real
- Home distractions
- Harder to separate work and life

## My Setup

- Dedicated workspace
- Regular video calls with the team
- Daily walks to break up the day

Overall: 10/10 would recommend!
