# Building My First SSG

I decided to build a static site generator to better understand how they work.

## The Architecture

The basic flow is simple:
1. Read markdown files
2. Convert to HTML
3. Apply templates
4. Generate static pages

## Challenges

- Template rendering
- Asset management
- Performance optimization

It's been a great learning experience!
