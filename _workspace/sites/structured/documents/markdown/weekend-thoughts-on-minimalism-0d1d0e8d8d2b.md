# Weekend Thoughts on Minimalism

This weekend I spent some time decluttering my workspace.

## The Process

I removed everything that didn't serve a purpose. The result? A cleaner mind and better focus.

## Key Takeaways

- Less is often more
- Physical clutter affects mental clarity
- Keep only what you truly need

Highly recommend trying this!
