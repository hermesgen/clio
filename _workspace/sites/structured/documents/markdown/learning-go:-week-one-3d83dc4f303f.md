# Learning Go: Week One

I started learning Go this week and it's been an interesting journey.

## First Impressions

Go is surprisingly simple yet powerful. The syntax is clean and the standard library is comprehensive.

## What I Learned

- Basic syntax and data types
- Goroutines and channels
- Error handling patterns

Looking forward to week two!
