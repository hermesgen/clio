# Debugging Like a Pro

Debugging is an art. Here are my top strategies.

## Essential Techniques

- **Read the error message**: Sounds obvious, but many skip this
- **Divide and conquer**: Binary search through your code
- **Rubber duck debugging**: Explain the problem out loud

## Tools I Use

- Print statements (yes, really)
- Debugger when needed
- Git bisect for regression bugs

Master these and you'll save hours!
