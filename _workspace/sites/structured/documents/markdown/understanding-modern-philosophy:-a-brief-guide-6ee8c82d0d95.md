# Understanding Modern Philosophy: A Brief Guide

Modern philosophy, spanning from the 17th century to the present day, is characterized by a shift from theological concerns to human reason and experience. Key movements include Rationalism, Empiricism, Existentialism, and Postmodernism, each offering unique perspectives on knowledge, reality, and ethics.

## Key Figures and Movements

- **Rationalism (Descartes, Spinoza)**: Emphasizes reason as the primary source of knowledge.
- **Empiricism (Locke, Hume)**: Argues that knowledge comes primarily from sensory experience.
- **Existentialism (Sartre, Camus)**: Focuses on individual existence, freedom, and responsibility.
- **Postmodernism (Foucault, Derrida)**: Challenges grand narratives and universal truths.

Engaging with modern philosophy helps us critically examine our assumptions and understand the intellectual currents that shape our world.
