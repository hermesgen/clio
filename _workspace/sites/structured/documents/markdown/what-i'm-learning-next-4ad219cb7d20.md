# What I'm Learning Next

Always learning, always growing. Here's what's on my list.

## Technical Skills

1. **Rust**: For systems programming
2. **WebAssembly**: The future of web performance
3. **Distributed systems**: Understanding scalability

## Non-Technical

- Writing: Improving my communication
- Public speaking: Conquering my fear
- Design: Better UI/UX sense

## The Plan

One topic at a time, deep focus, deliberate practice.

Let's see where this takes me!
