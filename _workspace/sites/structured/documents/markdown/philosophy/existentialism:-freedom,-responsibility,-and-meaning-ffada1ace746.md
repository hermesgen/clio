# Existentialism: Freedom, Responsibility, and Meaning

Existentialism is a philosophical movement that emphasizes individual existence, freedom, and responsibility. It posits that humans define their own meaning in life, and try to make rational decisions in an irrational universe. Key thinkers like Sartre, Camus, and Kierkegaard explored themes of anguish, alienation, and the search for authenticity in a world without inherent purpose.

## Core Tenets

- **Existence Precedes Essence**: We are born without inherent purpose and define ourselves through our choices.
- **Freedom and Responsibility**: We are condemned to be free, and thus fully responsible for our actions.
- **Anguish**: The feeling of dread and responsibility that comes with absolute freedom.
- **Absurdity**: The conflict between the human tendency to seek inherent value and meaning in life and the human inability to find any in a purposeless, meaningless or irrational universe.

Existentialism challenges us to confront the realities of our freedom and to create meaning in a world that offers none by default.

## Key Figures

- **Jean-Paul Sartre**: French philosopher, playwright, novelist, political activist.
- **Albert Camus**: French philosopher, author, and journalist, known for his concept of the absurd.
- **Søren Kierkegaard**: Danish philosopher, theologian, poet, social critic, and religious author.
